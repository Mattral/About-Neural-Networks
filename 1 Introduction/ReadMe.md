Neural networks are the cornerstone of modern deep learning and have revolutionized a wide range of applications, from image recognition to natural language processing. In this introductory note, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of neural networks, their biological inspiration, and the core components that make them work.

## Neural Networks: An Abstract Representation

At their core, neural networks are mathematical models designed to approximate complex, often non-linear, relationships in data. They draw inspiration from the human brain's neural structure but should be seen as abstract computational models.

### Biological Inspiration

The concept of neural networks is inspired by the human brain's interconnected neurons. While neural networks differ significantly from their biological counterparts, they share the idea of interconnected processing units (neurons) that work collectively to solve complex tasks.

## Components of a Neural Network

A neural network is composed of several fundamental components, each playing a crucial role in the model's functioning. Understanding these components is vital for grasping the inner workings of neural networks.

### Neurons

Neurons, or nodes, are the basic computational units in a neural network. Mathematically, a neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs, applies an activation function, and produces an output. This computation is often represented as:

Output=f(∑ 
i=1
n
​
 (w 
i
​
 ⋅x 
i
​
 )+b)


 ```
[ \text{Output} = f(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \cdot x_i) + b) ]

// LaTeX Expression
```

Where:
- {Output} is the neuron's output.
- \( f \) is the activation function.
- \( n \) is the number of inputs.
- \( w_i \) are the weights associated with each input.
- \( x_i \) are the input values.
- \( b \) is the bias term.

### Weights and Biases

The weights (\( w_i \)) and bias (\( b \)) terms are the parameters of the neuron. These parameters are adjusted during the training process to enable the network to learn from data. The weights control the strength of connections between neurons, while the bias allows for shifts in the output.

### Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the model. Common activation functions include the sigmoid function, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and the hyperbolic tangent (tanh). Activation functions enable neural networks to approximate complex functions and capture non-linear relationships in data.

### Layers

Neurons are organized into layers within a neural network. The most basic type of neural network, the feedforward neural network (FNN), comprises three types of layers: input, hidden, and output layers.

## Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)

A Feedforward Neural Network, or FNN, is the simplest form of neural network. It is called "feedforward" because information flows in one direction, from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer, without forming cycles. The fundamental purpose of an FNN is to approximate a function that maps input data to an output.

In an FNN, the input layer receives data, hidden layers perform computations, and the output layer provides the network's result. The output of one layer serves as the input to the next layer. The transformations that occur within each layer are the result of weighted sums and activation functions applied to the inputs.

An FNN can be represented as a mathematical function that maps inputs (\(x\)) to outputs (\(y\)) through a series of layers and transformations:

y=f 
N
​
 (f 
N−1
​
 (…f 
2
​
 (f 
1
​
 (x))…))

 ```
\[ y = f_N(f_{N-1}(\ldots f_2(f_1(x))\ldots)) \]
//LaTeX expression
```

Where:
- \(f_i\) represents the transformation at layer \(i\).
- \(x\) is the input.
- \(y\) is the output.

FNNs are versatile and serve as the foundation for more complex neural network architectures. They are employed in various machine learning tasks, including classification and regression, and they continue to be a key building block in deep learning.
